# TL;DR
# ------------------------
# ActivityPub is a social networking protocol that provides 
# realtime messaging, object-action semantics, and a richer 
# set of abstractions for Web-based messaging, with strong
# user-to-user and user-to-resource semantics. It uses the 
# actor model, as well as familiar data formats like JSON-LD, 
# to more meaningfully represented Linked Data, which is great 
# for semantic queries that map to real-world communication. 
# I'd recommend taking a look and learning the API. My attempt
# with this repo is to put together a bare-bones implementation
# that serves as a useful example for others to follow, without
# prematurely bringing out the Rails bazooka too soon. 
# 
# Philosophical background
# ------------------------
# ActivityPub is a new Web standard intended to define a protocol for 
# decentralized social networking based on Activity Streams 2.0 data 
# format. 
# Its origins can be traced back to Pump.io's implementation of an 
# extension of the realtime messaging & async interaction abstraction 
# for developers to build systems that interact with the Federated Web. 
# In particular, Mastodon, a pre-eminent social network that has made 
# an effort to provide an alternative to the bird-brained Internet 
# company's repeated encroachment on people's privacy, has implemented 
# support for ActivityPub, and their efforts to give people options outside of 
# just the FANGS is a laudable expenditure of effort.
#
# Privacy and the ongoing collection of data and metadata about you,
# your interactions, your physical presence, gives giant companies
# more information on individuals than has ever been possible prior 
# to our present era. In the future, I'd like to see the Web fulfill 
# its promise of empowering users rather than turning them into a 
# marketplace for attention, to be bought and sold by advertisers. 
# While still the information-dense place it used to be, with more 
# and more varied and interesting content being published or streamed 
# every single minute of the day, # the centralization of power that 
# network hubs are able to accumulate will only begin to lose 
# momentum when we decide to build better alternatives that solve 
# the same IRL problems that lead # to the flocking to these 
# networks in the 1st place. Developers instead should try to 
# take these # next-gen, realtime protocols to build decentralized 
# applications that people want to use. Until then, nothing will 
# change. ActivityPub is just a networking protocol for realtime 
# communication, but it makes the process of creating alternative 
# social networking applications much more accessible than before.

# I think ActivityPub gives Web programmers a valuable new standard
# to follow that is deeply meaningful in the age of Web 2.0 + beyond, 
# where everything is realtime, and where people want to take back
# control of their interactions, messages, and the data they produce, 
# share, under the very reasonable expectation that it will be theirs 
# forever. But only implementers can make this happen: do the Right 
# Thing.
